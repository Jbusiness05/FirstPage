  <!-- This is how you comment Html will ignore this
  The table tag needs 3 things: table, tr for table row, and td for table data-->
  <p>The real is back, the ville is back
    <br>
    Flow bananas here, peel this back
    <br>
    And what you'll find is, your highness
    <br>
    Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
    <br>
    Carolina's finest
    <br>
    You knew that already
    <br>
    And turned to the greatest, I proved that already
    <br>
    And if you would like, I do it twice
    <br>
    I just sharpen my blade for a minute but came lost in my ways
    <br>
    This for my Blanks that was tossin' the graves
    <br>
    Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts and get lost in the days
    <br>
    We used to play before your coffin was made
    <br>
    Just got the call Blank got caught with a straight
    <br>
    Hope he's okay
    <br>
    Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
    <br>
    Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
    <br>
    Who know a Blank fall to well, and that's the danger
    <br>
    Know me better than I know myself
    <br>
    I rip a page out my notebook in anger
    <br>
    And let these thoughts linger singing
    <br>
    Don't give 'em too much you
    <br>
    Don't let 'em take control
    <br>
    This one thing you do
    <br>
    Don't let 'em taint your soul
    <br>
    If you believe in God
    <br>
    One things for sure
    <br>
    If you ain't aim too high
    <br>
    Then you aim too low
    <br>
    What's the price for a black man life?
    <br>
    I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
    <br>
    I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
    <br>
    Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
    <br>
    Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights, cameras and action
    <br>
    May no man alive come through and damage my faction
    <br>
    I brought you Blank with me cause I love you like my brothers
    <br>
    And your mothers' like my mother
    <br>
    Think we need a plan of action
    <br>
    The bigger we get the more likely egos collide
    <br>
    It's just physics, please let's put our egos aside
    <br>
    You my Blanks, and should our worst tenancies turn us into enemies
    <br>
    I hope that we remember these
    <br>
    Nights fulla Hennessey
    <br>
    When Hov aroun we switch up to that D'usse
    <br>
    Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
    <br>
    Cause we from where you from
    <br>
    I'm not talkin' bout the slums
    <br>
    I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black Blank dumb
    <br>
    Keep a black Blank dyin' by a black Blank gun
    <br>
    And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap Blanks son
    <br>
    Yeah I said son
    <br>
    This is New York's finest
    <br>
    For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
    <br>
    Like show me New York's ladder
    <br>
    I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama
    <br>
    to force the air force to find it
    <br>
    Never mind it, you'll never reach that
    <br>
    Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
    <br>
    That's every track
    <br>
    Don't give 'em too much you
    <br>
    Don't let 'em take control
    <br>
    This one thing you do
    <br>
    Don't let 'em taint your soul
    <br>
    If you believe in God
    <br>
    One things for sure
    <br>
    If you ain't aim too high
    <br>
    Then you aim too low
    <br>
    I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
    <br>
    I ain't bring no lies, Blanks sang my quotes
    <br>
    I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
    <br>
    Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
    <br>
    You Blanks might be L or you might be Kane
    <br>
    Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
    <br>
    Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
    <br>
    But check your birth date Blank, you ain't the God
    <br>
    Nah you ain't the God
    <br>
    Blank Cole the God
